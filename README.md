# LeetCode Solutions 📚

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! Here, I store my solutions to various LeetCode problems using the **LeetHub v2 Chrome extension**, which automatically syncs my submissions to GitHub.

## 🚀 About
This repository serves as a personal archive of my progress and learning journey through solving algorithmic and data structure problems on LeetCode.

## 🏗 Structure
LeetHub v2 organizes solutions in the following format:
```
📂 LeetCode-Solutions
 ┣ 📂 problem-name
 ┃ ┣ 📜 solution.extension  (e.g., solution.py, solution.java)
 ┃ ┣ 📜 README.md  (auto-generated problem description)
 ┗ 📜 README.md
```
Each solution includes:
- **Problem description** (auto-generated by LeetHub)
- **Code implementation**
- **Time and space complexity analysis**
